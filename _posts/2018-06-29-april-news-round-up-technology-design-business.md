# What's happening out there

## The retail blood bath

With Amazon branching out to more areas, the retail battle (both online and offline) has been heating up: 

- Retailers around the world such as Alibaba and Walmart testing and deploying tech to [automate stores](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/technology/retailer-stores-automation-amazon.html).
- Industry leading brands are also beginning to seek more control over their own distribution channels as direct-to-consumer smaller players pop up.
- CPG brands start competing with their previous partners, as retail stores push their own private labels.
- Brands try to leverage technologies to keep consumers, blurring the physical and digital boundaries.

## Functionality over form for Amazon

How the commerce giant win customers with its [design theory](https://www.fastcodesign.com/90160960/the-design-theory-behind-amazons-5-6-billion-success) that doesn't revolve around aesthetics: Look beneath the interface.

## More than just a pretty face 

The beauty industry has taken advantage of digital tech to up the game. Augmented Reality has become more popular as a try-on aid for many brands. The recent acquisition of [Modiface](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/loreal-buys-beauty-tech-firm-modiface) helped L'Oreal in the AR race. 

Meanwhile, Sephora has pioneered a variety of [in-store technologies](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-sephora-is-leveraging-ar-and-ai-to-transform-retail-and-help-customers-buy-cosmetics/) such as interactive screens, RFID scanning and so on. 

It would be interesting to see how these brands thrive amid a retail crisis by embracing technology.

# Handy business tips

**Avoid shaming your users in UX design**

A website popup asks you to sign up for a newsletter, with the options "Yes" and "No, I'd prefer to be miserable." Don't use this [dark pattern](https://medium.com/@rizwanjavaid/shaming-users-is-a-horrible-idea-c2277c86c062). 

**How to "use" your boss**

This company has a [user guide](http://firstround.com/review/the-indispensable-document-for-the-modern-manager/) for employees on how to "use" their leader, which communicates clear expectations and the leader's working style. 

# Weird & wonderful

üç£ 3D printed edible [pixelated sushis](https://mashable.com/2018/03/11/3d-printed-8-bit-sushi-sxsw/#vo1m.gj9kgq8) that look like they belong in an 8-bit video game. Totally Instagram-worthy.

üêù Walmart recently filed a patent for [robot bees](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/03/autonomous-robot-bees-are-being-patented-by-walmart), which act as ‚Äúpollination drones.‚Äù Can this be the future of agriculture?
