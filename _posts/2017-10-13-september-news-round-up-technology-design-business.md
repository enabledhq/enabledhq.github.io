# What's happening out there

## Publishers vs. Facebook (and Google)

The shakeout in the publishing industry is similar to what is occurring in the retail industry, where Amazon might spark a “retail apocalypse”:

- Facebook & Google dominated digital ads, causing disenchantment among publishers
- Streaming videos touted as the next frontier, at a cost to publishers
- Publishers fighting back to take control of their platforms and the video streams. Who will win in the next phase of the digital content revolution?

## Minimum Awesome Product

## Long read: Unified Theory of Design

## Augmented Reality wave

iOS 11 has sparked a resurge of interest in AR apps. From useful utilities like IKEA's product visualisation app, to creating a gif-filled world just for fun with Giphy. But beneath that is an AR platform war between the giants.
