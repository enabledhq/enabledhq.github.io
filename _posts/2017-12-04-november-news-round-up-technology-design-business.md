# What's happening out there

## Tesla's next shiny things

The company generated a lot of buzz with the recent announcement of:

- The 2nd generation [Roadster](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/17/16655800/tesla-electric-semi-truck-roadster-recap-elon-musk) that goes from 0 to 100kph in 1.9 secs

With production problems of their other car models, many have questioned Tesla's [long-term](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4122890-tesla-approaches-terminal-decline?) viability. Yet some praise Tesla's vision and point to their high [valuation](https://thinkgrowth.org/tesla-how-to-lose-700-million-and-maintain-a-60-billion-valuation-107e777b530).

## From a tool to an ecosystem

## Long read: See that tech disruption coming?

In response to [impending disruption](https://medium.com/startup-grind/what-technology-disruption-always-does-for-or-to-your-business-4b3bd5d7f59c), a business may suddenly declare it is going to ‚ÄúTransform‚Äù or ‚ÄúInnovate,‚Äù but it often also wants to hold onto what it has been in the past‚Ää. Self-disruption may be the way to go.

## The real business of Virtual Reality

Facebook wants a billion people in VR with its new VR headset [Oculus Go](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41590202) that doesn't require a seperate computer to work. Will this revolutionise social - by giving people a [safe place](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/15/16478084/interview-rachel-franklin-spaces-social-vr-facebook) to play out cause & effect - or pass off as another [tech gimmick](http://www.zdnet.com/article/facebook-to-unveil-virtual-reality-headset-which-needs-no-pc/)?
