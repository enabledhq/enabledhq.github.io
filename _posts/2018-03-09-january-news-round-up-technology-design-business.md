# What's happening out there

## Amazon Go and cashier-less store

The first [Amazon Go](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/21/technology/inside-amazon-go-a-store-of-the-future.html) opened in Seattle. Is this the future of grocery shopping?

*Amazon Go store*

Some are skeptical about how this works for Amazon (reports of [accidental stealing](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/amazon-go-supermarket-no-checkouts-shoplift-accident-journalist-review-deirdre-bosa-a8174481.html)), or for millions of cashier jobs. Meanwhile, Amazon is marching on with their vertical and horizontal [integration strategies](https://stratechery.com/2018/amazons-go-and-the-future/).

## From a tool to an ecosystem

Shopify grew from a tool to a platform to an [ecosystem](https://producthabits.com/shopify-grew-snowboard-shop-10b-commerce-ecosystem/). How? Constant innovation & investment in new tech to delight users. They've strengthened their core offering and evolved in the e-commerce space. 

This reminds us of the [iCat app](http://enabled.com.au/sidestudy/clipsal-icat)'s evolution that we've been working on with our client [Clipsal](https://enabled.com.au/casestudy-Clipsal).

## Long read: Build an unforgettable first-time user experience

## The software architecture that powers Netflix

The (hugely simplified) complex stuff that happens every time you hit Play - Or the significance of [Cloud and Microservices](https://medium.com/refraction-tech-everything/how-netflix-works-the-hugely-simplified-complex-stuff-that-happens-every-time-you-hit-play-3a40c9be254b) in running a platform like Netflix, even if that means using rival Amazon's AWS cloud services.

# Weird & wonderful

ðŸš— Automaker allows people to pay for brand new cars with [Youtube views](http://creativity-online.com/work/opel-pay-with-views/53174) of videos they uploaded of test drives.  

ðŸ’» Dictionary of [online behaviour](http://dictionaryofonlinebehavior.com/), including "instameet" and "pinboast." Know anyone who's committed these? 

# Inside Enabled

## Team Day
