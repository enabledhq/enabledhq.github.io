## The state of Conversational UI and Chatbot Apis


### not exactly sure what this post will end up being about, but I've found some iteresting readings on the topics of:
	- conversationalUI
    - ChatBots & ChatBot Api's
    - The state of "AI" in these platforms
    
    

Conversational UI is seen as the next big thing in UI and UX design. Along with this shift, more and more commercial tools are becoming available to help implement conversational UI (by way of chatbots) into our current tools and services. I will endeavour to answer the following questions:

- What are Conversational User Interfaces? And why are they "the next big thing"?
- What is the current state of chatbot apis? (although there are many other posts about this, so we mightn't go into too much detail, other than to conver the field)
- Is this AI? How is is related to AI?


Conversational User Interfaces
- inspired by the WeChats and KaKao's of the world, Silicon Valley is looking to chat style interfaces
	- messaging apps are the top of app stores
    - yet still poorly integrated, 
    - are chatbots really the future? Some people disagree. Or perhaps the current direction touted by Facebook and Google is simply wrong
    	- Hybrids of the command line of old and the GUI of today
        - typing sucks on phones still!!! Why is nobody talking about that?
        - Also, who would ever want to book flights over text?
        - Facebook, with 1 billion monthly active users (Jan 2017) of facebook messenger, and 1.2 billion monthly active users (Jun 2016) is poised to make a big impact in this space



What is the current state of chatbot apis? 
	- Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM are all players in this space
