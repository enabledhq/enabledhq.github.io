- Amazon's Solution
- My Solution

- How it works & Code snippets
- Comparison with other esp. Data Pipeline
	- Pricing
    - Ease of use and configuration
    - Lambda timeouts
    	- how to get around this?
- Drawbacks and hurdles
	- S3 triggers! WTF???
    - Serverless and Cloudformation, not so friendly
