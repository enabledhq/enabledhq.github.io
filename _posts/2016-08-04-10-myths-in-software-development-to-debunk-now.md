title: 10 Myths in Software Development to Debunk Now
---
Accountants see things in numbers. Lawyers scrutinise every word you say. Rock stars do drugs. We have a set of expectations that are sometimes stereotypical, or even unfounded, for each profession.

Although we can’t speak on behalf of accountants, lawyers and rock stars, we can for software developers. Read on for an insider’s view of how “nerdy and geeky code crunchers” really work.

#Myth 1: Software development is a predictable process

When we find something difficult to understand (because it’s abstract or vague), we tend to think about it in more tangible terms. 

People might think building software is similar to building a house from a plan, which is a linear process. The purpose of software development is creating something people have never seen before, especially with custom software. Hence, it is almost impossible to give 100% accurate estimates.
You need to account for uncertainty, e.g. feature creep, external market factors, technology change.

For instance, Microsoft’s Windows Vista took 5 years to develop, even though it was only intended to be a minor upgrade from Windows XP.

#Myth 2: Adding more people will speed production up

Although we can’t see, touch or smell software, people sometimes assume a normal supply chain would apply.

Following from the first myth, people use common economics principles to manage software development projects.

The famous Brooks’ law (from [The Mythical Man-Month](https://archive.org/details/mythicalmanmonth00fred)) states software projects are “complex engineering endeavours” and it takes time for people added later to a project to become truly productive.
