# What's happening out there

## The Facebook data saga
The social media giant was recently caught up in a range of data-related scandals. The question is, did a breach of privacy occur or did Facebook users actually give the social giant permission to share personal information to other companies? Read more on this:

- Mark Zuckerberg took out ads to apologise for a "[breach of trust](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/25/europe/facebook-zuckerberg-cambridge-analytica-sorry-ads-newspapers-intl/index.html)" regarding the Cambridge Analytica scandal
- More news broke that Facebook had been scraping call and text message data from [Android phones](http://www.zdnet.com/article/facebook-was-tracking-your-text-message-and-phone-call-data-now-what/) for years
- 59% of respondents in a survey said Facebook would have a net [negative effect](https://www.statista.com/chart/13296/net-impact-of-tech-companies-on-society/) on society in 10 years

Looking at this from an [app design perspective](https://www.fastcodesign.com/90164921/facebook-has-an-app-problem), where do we draw the line between convenience in user experience and privacy protection?

## Functionality over form for Amazon

How the commerce giant win customers with its [design theory](https://www.fastcodesign.com/90160960/the-design-theory-behind-amazons-5-6-billion-success) that doesn't revolve around aesthetics: Look beneath the interface.

## More than just a pretty face 

The beauty industry has taken advantage of digital tech to up the game. Augmented Reality has become more popular as a try-on aid for many brands. The recent acquisition of [Modiface](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/loreal-buys-beauty-tech-firm-modiface) helped L'Oreal in the AR race. 

Meanwhile, Sephora has pioneered a variety of [in-store technologies](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-sephora-is-leveraging-ar-and-ai-to-transform-retail-and-help-customers-buy-cosmetics/) such as interactive screens, RFID scanning and so on. 

It would be interesting to see how these brands thrive amid a retail crisis by embracing technology.

# Handy business tips

**Avoid shaming your users in UX design**

A website popup asks you to sign up for a newsletter, with the options "Yes" and "No, I'd prefer to be miserable." Don't use this [dark pattern](https://medium.com/@rizwanjavaid/shaming-users-is-a-horrible-idea-c2277c86c062). 

**How to "use" your boss **
