# What's happening out there

## Publishers vs. Facebook (and Google)

The shakeout in the publishing industry is similar to what is occurring in the retail industry, where Amazon might spark a ‚Äúretail apocalypse‚Äù:

- Facebook & Google dominated digital ads, causing disenchantment among publishers
- Streaming videos touted as the next frontier, at a cost to publishers
- Publishers fighting back to take control of their platforms and the video streams. Who will win in the next phase of the digital content revolution?

## Minimum Awesome Product

The purpose of the MVP is to be customer-driven instead of being product-driven. But many still confuse the concept with "half-baked prototypes." Maybe time to call it a Minimum Awesome Product instead?

## Long read: Unified Theory of Design

An interesting theory for designing just about everything called CAMP. It‚Äôs an acronym for Context - Architecture - Mechanics - Poetics. A fav quote: "Digital products become experiences when people use them."

## Augmented Reality wave

iOS 11 has sparked a resurge of interest in AR apps. From useful utilities like IKEA's product visualisation app, to creating a gif-filled world just for fun with Giphy. But beneath that is an AR platform war between the giants.

# Handy business tips

**Want productive meetings?**

Don't spend 90% of your time talking about the 10% of things you disagree on. Find the [common ground](https://hackernoon.com/the-90-agreement-rule-36757dcc8eaa).

**User needs are human needs**

Use Maslow's [hierarchy of needs](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/user-needs-look-no-further-than-everyday-needs) to help you look at your designs in a different way. Does your product address a need?
