With production problems of their other car models, many have questioned Tesla's [long-term](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4122890-tesla-approaches-terminal-decline?) viability. Yet some praise Tesla's vision and point to their high [valuation](https://thinkgrowth.org/tesla-how-to-lose-700-million-and-maintain-a-60-billion-valuation-107e777b530).

## The software architecture that powers Netflix

The (hugely simplified) complex stuff that happens every time you hit Play - Or the significance of [Cloud and Microservices](https://medium.com/refraction-tech-everything/how-netflix-works-the-hugely-simplified-complex-stuff-that-happens-every-time-you-hit-play-3a40c9be254b) in running a platform like Netflix, even if that means using rival Amazon's AWS cloud services.
