# What's happening out there

## Taking back from the tech giants 

Retailers try to take [ad revenue](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-advertising-insight/retailers-set-sights-on-facebook-google-ad-revenue-idUSKBN1KG0CZ) away from Facebook and Google by selling ad slots on their own websites to manufacturers, similar to selling shelf position in the physical world => Clever way to fight back the "retail apocalypse" and take advantage of questionable online ad ROI.

As boundaries between the digital & physical world blur:

- Internet companies want more physical touchpoints: Amazon opening cashier-less stores, Google planning a retail flagship store in Chicago
- Traditional retailers go big with digital: Walmart attempting to pursue VR for shopping from home

## Technical debt in marketing 

Similar to tech debt in IT, [technical debt](https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2018/07/tech-bankrupting-marketing/) in marketing is a growing concern for many organisations. "You need to deploy technology nimbly and decouple from the mother ship of legacy systems."

## Long read: One way to thrive in the Amazon era

As the giant extends its reach, one retailer is fighting back by providing "[personal chief technology officers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-07-19/best-buy-should-be-dead-but-it-s-thriving-in-the-age-of-amazon)", and it's working. Best Buy should have been dead, but they've tweaked their proposition to focus on sending staff into people's homes.

This allows them to tick a customer's job-to-be-done which Amazon's not providing: advice and help in installing & using electronics.
