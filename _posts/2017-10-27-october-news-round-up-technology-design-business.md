## Ways to beat Amazon

With price competitiveness in their DNA, Amazon seems unbeatable, as evident in their [cloud](https://medium.com/@mikeal/amazon-is-terrifying-7333422ec40d) offering. But there is still hope:

- Don't go after commodity categories. Build a strong [brand](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/27/how-to-beat-amazon-insight-venture-partners-deven-parekh.html).

- Retailers react in the wake of Amazon/Whole Foods deal, so implement an [ecommerce strategy](https://www.geekwire.com/2017/amazons-13-7b-purchase-whole-foods-blessing-disguise-instacart/) now if you don't have one.

In response to [impending disruption](https://medium.com/startup-grind/what-technology-disruption-always-does-for-or-to-your-business-4b3bd5d7f59c), a business may suddenly declare it is going to “Transform” or “Innovate,” but it often also wants to hold onto what it has been in the past . Self-disruption may be the way to go.

## The real business of Virtual Reality

Facebook wants a billion people in VR with its new VR headset [Oculus Go](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41590202) that doesn't require a seperate computer to work. Will this revolutionise social - by giving people a [safe place](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/15/16478084/interview-rachel-franklin-spaces-social-vr-facebook) to play out cause & effect - or pass off as another [tech gimmick](http://www.zdnet.com/article/facebook-to-unveil-virtual-reality-headset-which-needs-no-pc/)?
