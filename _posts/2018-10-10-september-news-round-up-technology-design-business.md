# What's happening out there

## The state of Artificial Intelligence in Enterprises

MIT Sloan Management Review’s 2018 [Global Report on AI](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/artificial-intelligence-in-business-gets-real/) highlights different levels of AI adoption within enterprises - Passives, Experimenters, Investigators, Pioneers: 

- A majority of companies expect AI to affect business model shifts
- Pioneers are less held back by “lack of leadership support” or an “unclear business case” for AI adoption
- Chinese companies are aggressively investing in AI business applications

## Long read: Digital privacy & consumer consent

Interesting read on consumer psychology and how people view privacy: We are fast to demand our privacy, though when offered privacy as an optional extra, even at a small price, we are fast to forgo it. 

The article touches on [various studies](https://hbr.org/cover-story/2018/09/uninformed-consent), including one where "people readily disclosed their friends’ email addresses in exchange for free pizza."

## Two decades of Google

20 years on, Google is the [dominant player](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/24/google-at-20-larry-page-sergey-brin-internet) in search (90% market share). But that could change with Amazon attacking online retail advertising. On other fronts, Facebook "wants to kill the web" and regulators want to curb Google's monopoly.

## The iPhone event 

By now, the new line of Apple's iPhones has already been all over the news. The [AI chips](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/from-iphone-to-aiphone-apples-new-chips-are-key-to-its-future-2018-09-12) that Apple designed themselves could be the key to their future. Apple also quietly updated the Service Pricing, which points to higher [hidden costs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2018/09/16/apple-new-iphone-xs-max-xr-upgrade-release-date-price-cost/#3cac090e7f26).

While some are going ga-ga over the new phones and flashy features, some have picked on the smaller stuff, like the "failed" [3D Touch](https://hackernoon.com/why-apples-3d-touch-failed-miserably-72545b608ad), or the [Walkie-Talkie](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watchs-walkie-talkie-is-practically-useless/) function on the new Apple WatchOS that let you live out your childhood's dream.

# Weird & wonderful

📦 Living in a limited space? Store stuff in your [ceiling](https://www.bumblebeespaces.com/), use an app to track and retrieve them.

🍌 This Korean supermarket is selling a pack of 6 [bananas](https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/story-bananas/314570/) of different ripeness. Genius?
