As much as experts, analysts, speakers, lecturers, consultants keep hailing whatever the current year as the year of [Customer Experience](http://blog.enabled.com.au/marketing-customer-experience/), UX fails are still everywhere.

These user experience flops can range from mildly inconvenient to downright frustrating. 

Meanwhile, startups and innovative companies have been wooing customers away from incumbents with superior UX and UI. 

As a user, I’m angry that bad UX is still happening in 2018. As a market observer, I’m concerned for the big corporations that are letting things slip past the cracks. 

Now let’s dive into the list of UX fails that I’ve encountered from a variety of industries.

# Banking and Finance

Recently, I wrote a fairly extensive post on the [digital disruption](http://blog.enabled.com.au/fintech-banks-australia/) coming to banks and touched on the topic of UX by zooming in on ING Australia.  

Continuing that thread, I don’t understand why some financial institutions still put out digital experience that felt like it belonged in your grandma’s era. 

## 1. Virgin Money

I had been frustrated by not being able to press enter to log in after typing my password on the Virgin Money website (always had to then manually drag my mouse to click “Sign On”). Why the friction? 

![virgin money website]({{site.baseurl}}/images/img_UXfail_virginmoney2.png)

Finally, I discovered the reason:
  
![virgin money browser support]({{site.baseurl}}/images/img_UXfail_virginmoney1.png)  
  
Look at the limited number of [supported browsers](https://my.virginmoney.com.au/online-security/), especially if you’re a Mac user like me. Their reasoning to stop supporting outdated browsers or operating systems is to ensure the “highest standard” in data security. Fair enough. 

But if you look at the image again, it seems Windows 7 is “winning” here. Everyone should get Windows 7 in order to be supported by Virgin Money website. 

Next, their virtually non-existent mobile app. Why? Because you won’t be able to use it without **calling** their Customer Care Team to get a secure token (see the last screen of the image below).  

![virgin money app]({{site.baseurl}}/images/img_UXfail_virginmoney.png)

Judging by the user rating of 1.1 out of 5 on the App Store, the Virgin Money app has a loooong way to go (which is funny because they actually put out an update to support iPhone X face ID – talk about priorities). 

## 2. HSBC

Check out the online sign-up process for an account at HSBC.

After filling in an ugly online form, you have to **print** out two other forms, complete them, find a suitable referee to sign your form, and believe it or not, post it to them (see image). 

![hsbc online sign up ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/img_UXfail_HSBC.png)

Which era are we in? Especially after being exposed to the better UX by other financial institutions and fintech startups, this is off-putting. 


## 3. Commonwealth Bank of Australia

I’ve mentioned CBA in my previous post when comparing the big banks’ [mobile apps](http://blog.enabled.com.au/fintech-banks-australia/) with ING’s. Now here are two of my pet peeves when it comes to the CBA app. 

**One**: I can’t set up a recurring transfer from my savings account to my normal account in the CBA app. 

Granted that it is a function not yet supported by CBA, why not prevent users from going all the way to the final step - after choosing start/end dates, payment frequency - only to see this error message?

![CBA mobile app ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/img_UXfail_CBA.jpg)

**Two**: The security code notification just won’t go away. Usually, you get this as a security measurement if you want to add a new payee, change your personal details etc. 

There’s no way to dismiss it on the screen or even after logging off or quitting the app altogether. Okay, this might not be a UX fail per se. But if you’re have a notification OCD like me, that could get on your nerve (!).

![CBA mobile app]({{site.baseurl}}/images/img_UXfail_CBA1.png)

# Logistics 

## Australia Post

Warning: a lot of venting ahead. This is my experience when AusPost lost my parcel by “safe dropping” it to the wrong address. 

Aside from how long it took (19 days) and how many hoops I had to jump through to get my missing item query resolved (in a less than satisfactory manner), their online [support portal](https://auspost.com.au/help-and-support) is not that user-friendly. 

**UX fail #1: following up on a lodged support request**

After being logged into MyPost, I clicked on Help and Support, which took me to a new tab that apparently required me to log in again (see image). Clicking on that Log in link took me to yet another tab with a list of my enquiries. 

![AusPost customer support]({{site.baseurl}}/images/img_UXfail_Auspost2.png)

**UX fail #2: half-hearted feedback seeking**

Why the limited character count in feedback form? As if they don’t want customers to list all the problems with Australia Post. 

![Australia post customer support feedback]({{site.baseurl}}/images/img_UXfail_Auspost.png)

I had to cut off my sentence there, which should have continued with: “might as well suggest the “Safe Drop” parcel feature when no one is home is not reliable and shouldn’t be used.”  

Target – who was the retailer that sent the parcel – dealt with my issue in a much more organised and empathetic way. Go Target! 

# Media & Publishing

## 1. Forbes

Forbes forces you to view the Welcome screen with Quote of the day and some ads. To dismiss it, you have to click “Continue to site”.

![forbes quote of the day]({{site.baseurl}}/images/img_UXfail_forbes1.png)

Many people find this landing page annoying: “For years, the Quote of the Day has been compromised [intellectually](https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/10/8014221/hackers-used-the-most-insulting-part-of-forbes-website-to-distribute).” Or as evidenced by these Google search results:

![forbes quote of the day annoying]({{site.baseurl}}/images/img_UXfail_forbes.png)

Worse, the Quote of the Day was at one point compromised from a [security standpoint](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/02/10/forbes-web-site-was-compromised-by-chinese-cyberespionage-group-researchers-say/) too. 

## 2. Enterprise Connect

For a website that talks about cutting edge [enterprise IT](https://www.enterpriseconnect.com/) and technology, this processing speed of email unsubscription seems on par with how a paper-based government body processes a query. 

![enterprise connect]({{site.baseurl}}/images/img_UXfail_ubm2.png)
 
## 3. CMO.com.au

This is what happens when you don’t moderate article comments but have them shown on every page as a sticky element. 

![cmo.com.au ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/img_UXfail_cmo.png)

The initial idea could be to give readers the impression of high content engagement. So yes, there’s high engagement, but high relevance? Probably not.  

# B2B Marketing

There seems to be a negative correlation between the pleasantness of UX/UI and the size of the target audience’s organisation. 

In other words, products that target more enterprise-y people tend to have more complicated, convoluted, or “ugly” user interface. 

## 1. SlideShare

Firstly, the search function seems broken. All the search results are the same no matter which page of the search results page you’re on. See video for illustration. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DA01TGmfdGI?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Secondly, analytics for the slides are different on the My Uploads tab and Analytics tab. 

## 2. HubSpot

This is where you go to unsubscribe or edit your email subscription preferences. 

![hubspot unsubscribe]({{site.baseurl}}/images/img_UXfail_hubspot1.png)

The only thing that HubSpot gets right after making me scroll through an impressive list of 29 types of emails, is yes, users have got “a lot of options.” 

Also, the social media icons are missing after the call-to-action “Follow us on”. For a marketing automation software company, this is pretty weird. 

# Getting lost in the Google jungle

Google is huge. So huge that you might feel different components of the same Google product are made by different companies. 

I can list a lot more but let’s just pick 2 Google products. 

## 1. Online branding for business

This is my experience dealing with this suite of products: Google+, My Business and About me. 

From the Enabled’s **Google+** Page, clicking on “Edit profile” triggers a pop-up which has “Manage Page” on it. Clicking that leads you to an **About me** page (in a different tab). Still can’t edit profile at this stage. 

On that **About me** page, there is an option to “Manage in **Google My Business**” which unsurprisingly triggers a new tab where you can edit local business info like opening hours, description, contact info etc. OK but where do I edit the Google+ profile?

Something is unnecessarily complex here. Let’s rewind a little. 

It turns out:

**On Google+**: You can edit your 140-character-long profile here => There should be a clearer indicator for that action on this page. 

![google plus profile edit]({{site.baseurl}}/images/img_UXfail_Googleplus.png)

**On the About me page**: You have to click the pen to edit your “Story”. The funny thing is, Google says changes made on this page will be reflected on Google+ (and others?), which is not the case. 

![google about me page]({{site.baseurl}}/images/img_UXfail_aboutme.png)

**On Google My Business**: You can edit yet another piece of profile information that shows up when someone search for your business on Google. 

What can be done here? One word: streamline. 

## 2. Google Photos

Google Photos is another example of confusing UI. Just a straightforward wish to save a photo to your device might take you in a loop of unnecessary steps. 

![google photos]({{site.baseurl}}/images/img_UXfail_photos.jpg)

Let’s say I want to save the selected image to my camera roll (Photos on iOS). I can’t get to that action unless I click on “Open in…”, which then takes me to a similar looking screen but this time with a “Save image” button. 

# Bonus UX fails that apply to many brands 

## 1. Disconnection between different parts of Customer Experience

This happens when a business sees UX as a separate “thing” that is not integrated with the whole CX as shown in the image below.

![UX vs CX]({{site.baseurl}}/images/img_UXfail_UXCX.png)

### Applying for a financial product online: 

Very often, you’d need to get in touch with the physical branch, and also very often you’d hear something like “Oh the online department is separate, you’d need to get in touch with them directly.” As if they don’t work for the same company after all. This sometimes applies to a retail setting as well. 

### Email/online interactions and physical mail are out of sync:

Have you ever received a physical letter days after you’ve completed or they’ve completed a certain action and it’s no longer relevant? 

Examples:

- A letter saying I need to upload/send verification documents after I’ve received my new credit card
- An email saying my new membership pack will arrive soon after I’ve already got it in the post.

Most of the times, these out-of-sync events are not disastrous but they can accumulate in the customer’s mind and weaken a good brand’s value. 

## 2. Content automatically loads when scroll down 

Infinite scrolling is the worst, especially when you’re looking to get to links in the footer. Why is it annoying? Infinite scrolling takes away control from users and can leave them disoriented. So use it [appropriately](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/infinite-scrolling-lets-get-to-the-bottom-of-this/) or don’t do it at all. 

From an ethical standpoint, infinite scrolling is questionable because it makes users engage with the product longer, tapping into addictive behavioural patterns in the digital era. This is why we've seen the defensive push around Digital Wellbeing recently from Google and Apple.

# Why do these weird UX choices still exist? 

Either these organisations are:

- Aware of the issue yet do not have the incentive to change (monetisation, advertising, politics) 
- Unaware (insufficient user research)
- Aware but do not know where to start (conflicting info, limited resources, organisational barriers)

## Towards delightful UX

As with any benchmarking, there’re multiple levels of UX maturity. Check out this UX pyramid:

<div style="text-align: center;width:50%;height:50%">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/img_UXfail_pyramid.png" alt="UX maturity pyramid">
  </div>

Most of the examples in this post stop at the Usable level. But some even stop before the Functional level. So they're far far away from the “[delight](https://medium.com/@101/stop-pushing-features-and-start-delight-users-ef639194c199)” level, which includes things like microcopy, microinteractions, animations, etc. 

Meanwhile, a lot of companies are seeing that high level UX is actually worth money.
How? Because having less friction and delighting customers, leads to more customers, who stay around for longer, and recommend you to even more potential customers. 

At the end of the day, who would you buy from? 

- A company that makes you print 2 forms, buy a stamp and wait 10 days  
- A company that lets you get the job done by getting into their app right away
