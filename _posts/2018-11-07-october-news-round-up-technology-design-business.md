# What's happening out there

## Good design is good for business

The first ever report conducted into the [value of design](https://www.dezeen.com/2018/10/25/good-design-good-for-business-mckinsey-company-report/) in business by McKinsey outlines 4 key themes around Design - more than a **feeling**, more than a **phase**, more than a **department** and more than a **product**. 

Enabled's been advocating a user-centric approach with our integrated design capabilities. And now the report highlights these nuggets of truth:

- "Design has gone from being a middle-management topic to a senior management topic"
- "Separate design departments don't work"
- There're financial returns for those doing it right

## Can tech be good for society?

"Companies know you better than you may know yourself." Apple CEO Tim Cook warns of danger around the growing "[data industrial complex](https://www.fastcompany.com/90256013/apples-tim-cook-warns-of-threat-from-growing-data-industrial-complex)".

Meanwhile, the UN released 2018's World Economic and Social Survey report, warning that [frontier technologies](https://apnews.com/2f92ef8facbe41519eece0be5f3c06d6) can help lives but boost inequality. 

## Why great products only do one thing

A good read on the simplicity philosophy that can be applied to [product development](https://uxplanet.org/why-greatest-products-do-only-one-thing-b57764559d1b), user experience design, software design etc. Examples include Apple, Nike, McDonalds and the Walkman.

## Google Pixel phone event 

There wasn't much room for surprises when Google unveiled the new Pixel 3 phones earlier this month. People had already seen the products & packaging photos thanks to extensive leaks.

As usual, there'll be comparisons with Apple's new iPhones, but you get different views depending on what's being compared.

# Weird & wonderful

üöΩ When "There's an app for it" is taken too far: In San Francisco, you can't use the toilet without downloading [an app](https://twitter.com/juanbuis/status/1034314525309263872).

üëö Unilever released [Day2](https://day2.com/), a spray that lets millennials postpone doing the laundry. Compelling proposition for busy folks.
