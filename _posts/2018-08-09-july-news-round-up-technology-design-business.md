# What's happening out there

## Data sharing between the tech giants 

Amid the recent data and privacy scandals, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter announced a joint initiative called the [Data Transfer Project](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17589246/data-transfer-project-google-facebook-microsoft-twitter), allowing users to move data between platforms: 

- Although still under development, this is good news for consumers
- ‚ÄúPortability and interoperability are central to cloud innovation and competition‚Äù - said Microsoft, who just bought the largest open-source dev platform [Github](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/) 
- Closer to home, the recent [My Health Record](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-24/digital-health-agency-changes-my-health-record-app-contracts/10026644) fall-out highlights the need to not only protect people's data but also communicating clearly about it

## Technical debt in marketing 

Similar to tech debt in IT, [technical debt](https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2018/07/tech-bankrupting-marketing/) in marketing is a growing concern for many organisations. "You need to deploy technology nimbly and decouple from the mother ship of legacy systems."

## Long read: One way to thrive in the Amazon era

As the giant extends its reach, one retailer is fighting back by providing "[personal chief technology officers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-07-19/best-buy-should-be-dead-but-it-s-thriving-in-the-age-of-amazon)", and it's working. Best Buy should have been dead, but they've tweaked their proposition to focus on sending staff into people's homes.

This allows them to tick a customer's job-to-be-done which Amazon's not providing: advice and help in installing & using electronics. 

# Handy business tips

# Weird & wonderful

üíî Perhaps on the weird side, WeChat trialled ["divorce"](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/wechat-messaging-app-launches-divorce-feature-in-china-2018-5?r=US&IR=T) function on the platform. Couples can now file for divorce via the app.  

üöÄ Finnish space tourism startup [Space Nation](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/app-attack-space-nation-navigator/) launched an app allowing anyone to train to become an astronaut, with a trip to space up for grabs.
