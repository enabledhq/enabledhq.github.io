Not long ago, I attended the seminar “The [Digital Education Disruption](https://blogs.adelaide.edu.au/adelaidex/2017/03/22/the-digital-education-disruption-kathy-pugh-edx/)” hosted at the University of Adelaide. The third oldest university in Australia had invited a speaker from one of the hottest edtech players in the world - edX. 

One could relish the coming together of old and new, slow and fast, the disrupted and disruptor. Or is it really that binary? 

The truth is, even universities as some of the most established institutions in society, are feeling the pinch of potential disruption from online learning. And they are doing something about it. Moreover, not just traditional universities, but the relatively new comers are also responding to the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) movement. 

Whether MOOCs would be able to replace universities is another topic, the point I want to make is: if slow-moving, colossal bodies such as educational institutions can do something to adapt to change, why wouldn’t businesses? 

# A traditional university’s response 

Before we go into what businesses can learn from the education sector, let’s look at the University of Adelaide as an example. 

It was a refreshing moment when Kathy Pugh - edX’s vice-president of Educational Services – mentioned the impact of Adelaide University on this global platform.

The [AdelaideX](https://www.edx.org/school/adelaidex) initiative has seen some interesting initial results for the university, such as high-rating courses, and commendation for instructors’ quality. 

Now let’s look closer at the digital education landscape. 

## Who are not consuming university courses?

To respond to potential disruption effectively, the first step is understanding why your competitors are gaining traction. In other words, find out who your competitors are going after. 

In the [Jobs to be done](http://blog.enabled.com.au/jobs-to-be-done/) framework, the concept of “non-consumption” explains this. Universities need to reach those who’re not consuming their products because they think degrees are too expensive or complex. 

- Online learning enabled by edtech players such as edX and Coursera can disrupt universities by:
- Making knowledge more accessible and in many cases, free
- Targeting those pursuing professional learning with self-paced courses
- Offering more vocational, modern, specific or just courses on subjects that you’d never find in university degrees (e.g. courses on 3D modelling, body language etc.)

Once universities identify where they’re most vulnerable, they can whether they need to respond and if so, in what manner. 

In the University of Adelaide’s case, [AdelaideX](https://www.edx.org/school/adelaidex) is the response. Now let’s analyse this move through the three lenses – human, technology, business. 

## Human factors

It’s not pure chance that human-centred design has gained prominence over the years. The simple truth that many fail to realise is that users/ customers have the final say. On the danger of mature companies’ [complacency](http://blog.enabled.com.au/web-summit-2016/): “Take your eyes off the problem and soon a competitor will be solving it better.”

AdelaideX, among similar offerings from other universities, recognises the need for education to meet learners where they are instead of dictating the program structure or location of learning. 
From what I gathered at the event, AdelaideX seems to target both existing on-campus students as well as new learners all around the world. 

The transparent course review and feedback system from users helps universities take user needs more seriously.

Nonetheless, human factors not only concern external users, but also internal stakeholders. During the panel discussion in the event I attended, it was evident that online courses have impacted the way lecturers teach as well. It would be interesting to see how university lecturers compete with individual course instructors on platforms like [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), who are usually high-profile subject domain experts or industry veterans. 

## Technology factors

Back in 1858, John Henry Newman described a university in [_The Idea of a University_](http://www.bartleby.com/28/2.html) as “a place for the communication and circulation of thought, by means of personal intercourse, through a wide extent of country.”

Even with the advent of the Internet, this idea still holds true. That means, in responding to online learning, universities need to do more than just moving content found in textbooks to a digital platform.

Here, we can use the example of the print media industry which had to undergo a [digital transformation](http://blog.enabled.com.au/digital-transformation/). To remain in business, newspapers could not rely on simply creating a digital version of their publications. Similarly, to compete, universities need to look at edtech as a means to an end rather than an end in itself.

They still require great instructors in the classroom and technology allows those teachers to scale what they’re doing. Blended learning might be the sweet spot for universities, as it combines face-to-face tuition with online tools. 

## Business factors

The University of Adelaide’s response to the rise of MOOCs marks its recognition of the unbundling trend. This is when start-ups chip away market share from the incumbent by providing users just the bit they need instead of the whole package.

Some obvious business benefits of programs like AdelaideX are: 

- New marketing and sales channel: reaching new market segments (previously non-consumers)
- Branding awareness/goodwill: not only in terms of academic reputation, but also social impact (free courses for those who can’t afford degree education)

It’s still too early to tell the ROI of AdelaideX, but as discussed at the event, it is viewed as a long-term investment which has many benefits you “can’t put a dollar value” on. Universities are hoping online courses can eventually convert learners into fee-paying students in their normal degree programs (which should take the blended learning approach mentioned above). 

As an interesting figure, the current conversion rate of AdelaideX is around 5%, which is not bad for such a new initiative.  

# No one can afford to do nothing

Universities and corporations are similar in the sense that they are businesses after all. Let’s look back at a few ways traditional universities can respond to the rise of online learning:

1. Believe that it can never replace the real experience and do nothing
2. Race to put courses online as everyone is doing it
3. Ask the right question before rushing to actions: what problems are we not solving or can we solve better for our users/learners? 

I believe the same narrative applies in the corporate setting, where companies contemplate what to do in the face of digital disruption. They can choose to downplay the risk of becoming irrelevant, race to buy more tech, or take a more holistic approach to [digital transformation](http://blog.enabled.com.au/digital-transformation/).

Back to the education sector, Clayton Christensen who coined the term “[Disruptive Innovation](http://blog.enabled.com.au/mass-disruption/)” considers MOOCs a potentially disruptive technology that can replace weak universities. Moreover, “fifteen years from now more than half of the universities [in America] will be in bankruptcy.”

An example of an industry that has transformed through effective innovations is health care. “The health care industry didn’t have multi-billion-dollar companies 15 to 20 years ago. Now it does. We’re at the beginning of changing education. We think education will follow a similar path,” said an [edtech](https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/ed-tech-vc-ceo-commentary/) accelerator founder. 

It’s evident that disruption is happening across the board. Are you taking the right action (if any)?
