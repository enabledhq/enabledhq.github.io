# What's happening out there

## Overcoming the "innovator's bias"

Creator of Lean Canvas - Ash Maurya - offers the solution (pun intended) to this, which is: "Love the problem, not [your solution](https://blog.leanstack.com/love-the-problem-not-your-solution-65cfbfb1916b)." We also featured him in our latest blog post. See it [here](https://blog.enabled.com.au/innovation-trap-lean-startup).

## Long read: How to know if tech is just a toy?

Using historical & present examples, the author argues the presence of a roadmap is why some [tech advancements](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2017/5/24/not-even-wrong-ways-to-dismiss-technology) can change the world while others remain toys. He also notes the distinction between assessing the objective capability vs. specific applications of tech (use cases).
