## Ways to beat Amazon

With price competitiveness in their DNA, Amazon seems unbeatable, as evident in their [cloud](https://medium.com/@mikeal/amazon-is-terrifying-7333422ec40d) offering. But there is still hope:

## Long read: See that tech disruption coming?

In response to [impending disruption](https://medium.com/startup-grind/what-technology-disruption-always-does-for-or-to-your-business-4b3bd5d7f59c), a business may suddenly declare it is going to ‚ÄúTransform‚Äù or ‚ÄúInnovate,‚Äù but it often also wants to hold onto what it has been in the past‚Ää. Self-disruption may be the way to go.
