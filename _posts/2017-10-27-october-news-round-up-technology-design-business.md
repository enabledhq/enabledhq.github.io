# What's happening out there

## Ways to beat Amazon

With price competitiveness in their DNA, Amazon seems unbeatable, as evident in their [cloud](https://medium.com/@mikeal/amazon-is-terrifying-7333422ec40d) offering. But there is still hope:

- Don't go after commodity categories. Build a strong [brand](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/27/how-to-beat-amazon-insight-venture-partners-deven-parekh.html).
- "If you can't beat 'em, [join 'em](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/302410?)."
- Retailers react in the wake of Amazon/Whole Foods deal, so implement an [ecommerce strategy](https://www.geekwire.com/2017/amazons-13-7b-purchase-whole-foods-blessing-disguise-instacart/) now if you don't have one.

Here are 4 [main strategies](http://andrewchen.co/how-to-build-a-billion-dollar-digital-marketplace-examples-from-uber-ebay-craigslist-and-more/).

## Long read: See that tech disruption coming?

In response to [impending disruption](https://medium.com/startup-grind/what-technology-disruption-always-does-for-or-to-your-business-4b3bd5d7f59c), a business may suddenly declare it is going to ‚ÄúTransform‚Äù or ‚ÄúInnovate,‚Äù but it often also wants to hold onto what it has been in the past‚Ää. Self-disruption may be the way to go.

## The real business of Virtual Reality

Facebook wants a billion people in VR with its new VR headset [Oculus Go](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41590202) that doesn't require a seperate computer to work. Will this revolutionise social - by giving people a [safe place](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/15/16478084/interview-rachel-franklin-spaces-social-vr-facebook) to play out cause & effect - or pass off as another [tech gimmick](http://www.zdnet.com/article/facebook-to-unveil-virtual-reality-headset-which-needs-no-pc/)?

# Handy business tips

**Want productive meetings?**

Don't spend 90% of your time talking about the 10% of things you disagree on. Find the [common ground](https://hackernoon.com/the-90-agreement-rule-36757dcc8eaa).

**User needs are human needs**

Use Maslow's [hierarchy of needs](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/user-needs-look-no-further-than-everyday-needs) to help you look at your designs in a different way. Does your product address a need?
