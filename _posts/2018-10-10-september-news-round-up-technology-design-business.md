# What's happening out there

## The state of Artificial Intelligence in Enterprises

MIT Sloan Management Review’s 2018 [Global Report on AI](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/artificial-intelligence-in-business-gets-real/) highlights different levels of AI adoption within enterprises - Passives, Experimenters, Investigators, Pioneers: 

- A majority of companies expect AI to affect business model shifts
- Pioneers are less held back by “lack of leadership support” or an “unclear business case” for AI adoption
- Chinese companies are aggressively investing in AI business applications

## Long read: Digital privacy & consumer consent

Interesting read on consumer psychology and how people view privacy: We are fast to demand our privacy, though when offered privacy as an optional extra, even at a small price, we are fast to forgo it. 

The article touches on [various studies](https://hbr.org/cover-story/2018/09/uninformed-consent), including one where "people readily disclosed their friends’ email addresses in exchange for free pizza."

## Super university

Reading the [discussion paper](http://www.newuniversity.nousgroup.com.au/discussion-paper-1) on the potential merger of University of Adelaide & UniSA reminds us of our article on the [digital disruption](http://blog.enabled.com.au/digital-disruption-education/) happening in education.

## Mixed Reality: mixed feelings 

Earlier this month, the [Magic Leap](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/08/magic-leap-one-creators-edition-first-look.html) mixed reality headset finally launched after years of hype and mystery, with a hefty price tag of USD2,300. And it's only available for developers.

Optimists think this is the next mobile computing frontier, after the smartphone. Others are less convinced, citing the [underwhelming](https://www.cnet.com/news/i-finally-tried-magic-leap-and-i-have-mixed-feelings/) first impression. Interesting space to watch nonetheless.
