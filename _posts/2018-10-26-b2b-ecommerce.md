As OroCommerce’s [solution partner](https://oroinc.com/b2b-ecommerce/partner/enabled), Enabled brings its consulting and software design experience to help clients wishing to deploy B2B ecommerce functionality.

Not taking partnerships lightly, Enabled believes Oro has the credentials and unique proposition for the B2B ecommerce market.

# The B2B ecommerce landscape

While the process of B2C commerce is pretty simple and straightforward, B2B commerce can become very complicated.

Within a single customer, there are more parties involved and unique workflows, e.g. purchase orders, approvals, competitive bids etc. That’s not to mention procurement processes may vary vastly between different sized companies in different industries and regions. 
 
There is a gap in the market. Most ecommerce systems have been built for the B2C market, then modified to try accommodate B2B as well, e.g. Magento, SAP Hybris.

Yet, with the B2B eCommerce market expected to hit $6.7 trillion by 2020, dwarfing that of B2C, businesses need to make the right investment to stay relevant.

*Based on diagram from [Customer Think](http://customerthink.com/31-reasons-why-b2b-ecommerce-and-personalization-technologies-are-a-good-match/)*

Enabled’s view is that customising a general B2C to fit complex business processes such as B2B ecommerce, is costly and problematic  over the long run. Hence, a ready out-of-the-box solution that can get businesses up and running fast is key. 

# OroCommerce - the solution for B2B ecommerce

Global market research firm Frost & Sullivan awarded the [New Product Innovation](https://ww2.frost.com/news/press-releases/frost-sullivan-selects-oro-inc-2017-b2b-ecommerce-new-product-innovation-award/) award to OroCommerce, recognizing it as the only open-source ecommerce platform built from the ground up for B2B businesses.

OroCommerce is an excellent platform for building B2B ecommerce solutions. Its out-of-the-box features are an excellent starting point, and the API is ideal for extending and integrating with popular systems such as PayPal, Mailchimp, Zendesk etc. Moreover, businesses also get the built-in full-featured CRM system with OroCommerce.

(We’ve previously discussed the role of APIs in the new [software paradigm](http://blog.enabled.com.au/microservices-innovation/).)

Interestingly, Oro's founders previously founded Magento and with deep experience in the space, they wanted to take on “subpar” [Magento](https://www.cmswire.com/digital-marketing/orocommerce-takes-on-subpar-magento-in-the-b2b-ecommerce-space/) in B2B ecommerce. 

Although being a new kid on the block, OroCommerce is getting noticed in the industry and is starting to be requested by Enabled's customers.
