# What's happening out there

## Ways to beat Amazon

With price competitiveness in their DNA, Amazon seems unbeatable, as evident in their [cloud](https://medium.com/@mikeal/amazon-is-terrifying-7333422ec40d) offering. But there is still hope:

- Don't go after commodity categories. Build a strong [brand](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/27/how-to-beat-amazon-insight-venture-partners-deven-parekh.html).
- "If you can't beat 'em, [join 'em](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/302410?)."
- Retailers react in the wake of Amazon/Whole Foods deal, so implement an [ecommerce strategy](https://www.geekwire.com/2017/amazons-13-7b-purchase-whole-foods-blessing-disguise-instacart/) now if you don't have one.

## Build a successful platform/marketplace

Starting small, marketplaces like eBay, Airbnb, Alibaba and Uber have become multi-billion-dollar businesses. How did they do it? Here are 4 [main strategies](http://andrewchen.co/how-to-build-a-billion-dollar-digital-marketplace-examples-from-uber-ebay-craigslist-and-more/). We also wrote about [platform business model](http://blog.enabled.com.au/platform-business-model) before.

## Long read: Unified Theory of Design

An interesting theory for designing just about everything called CAMP. It’s an acronym for Context - Architecture - Mechanics - Poetics. A fav quote: "[Digital products](https://medium.com/@cwodtke/a-unified-theory-for-designing-just-about-anything-b87f1e4f050b) become experiences when people use them."

## Augmented Reality wave

iOS 11 has sparked a resurge of interest in AR apps. From useful utilities like IKEA's product visualisation app, to creating a gif-filled world just for fun with Giphy. But beneath that is an [AR platform war](https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/29/16219208/apple-arkit-ar-apps-ikea-walking-dead-giphy-hungry-caterpillar-google) between the giants.

# Handy business tips

**Want productive meetings?**

Don't spend 90% of your time talking about the 10% of things you disagree on. Find the [common ground](https://hackernoon.com/the-90-agreement-rule-36757dcc8eaa).

**User needs are human needs**

Use Maslow's [hierarchy of needs](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/user-needs-look-no-further-than-everyday-needs) to help you look at your designs in a different way. Does your product address a need?
