# What's happening out there

## Taking back from the tech giants 

Retailers try to take [ad revenue](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-advertising-insight/retailers-set-sights-on-facebook-google-ad-revenue-idUSKBN1KG0CZ) away from Facebook and Google by selling ad slots on their own websites to manufacturers, similar to selling shelf position in the physical world => Clever way to fight back the "retail apocalypse" and take advantage of questionable online ad ROI.

As boundaries between the digital & physical world blur:

- Internet companies want more physical touchpoints: Amazon opening cashier-less stores, Google planning a retail flagship store in Chicago
- Traditional retailers go big with digital: Walmart attempting to [pursue VR](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-17/walmart-eyes-virtual-reality-shopping-system-patent-filings-say) for shopping from home

## Long read: What's edge computing?

Cloud computing has been a buzzword for some time now. But what about [edge computing](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/what-is-edge-computing/)? This nascent technology is starting to attract attention as we move to an even more Internet-connected ecosystem. Here's a good overview plus potential industry use cases.

## Super university

Reading the [discussion paper](http://www.newuniversity.nousgroup.com.au/discussion-paper-1) on the potential merger of University of Adelaide & UniSA reminds us of our article on the [digital disruption](http://blog.enabled.com.au/digital-disruption-education/) happening in education.

## Mixed Reality: mixed feelings 

Earlier this month, the [Magic Leap](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/08/magic-leap-one-creators-edition-first-look.html) mixed reality headset finally launched after years of hype and mystery, with a hefty price tag of USD2,300. And it's only available for developers.

Optimists think this is the next mobile computing frontier, after the smartphone. Others are less convinced, citing the [underwhelming](https://www.cnet.com/news/i-finally-tried-magic-leap-and-i-have-mixed-feelings/) first impression. Interesting space to watch nonetheless.  
 

# Weird & wonderful

üí∏ Dreaming of being able to fly like Iron Man? Now you can, just pay $600k for [this suit](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/this-real-life-iron-man-jet-suit-is-now-available-to-buy-richard-browning-2018-7).

üè¢ A skyscraper in China is fitted with a [waterfall](https://www.fastcompany.com/90215672/this-crazy-new-skyscraper-is-topped-with-a-functioning-waterfall) taller than Niagara Falls and costs $116/hr to run.
