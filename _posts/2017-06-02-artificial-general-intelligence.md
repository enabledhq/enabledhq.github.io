A new [security exploit](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/21/17377994/google-microsoft-cpu-vulnerability-speculative-store-bypass-variant-4?utm_source=Enabled+Main&utm_campaign=736da09fcb-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_03_16&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_249f96aedf-736da09fcb-) has been discovered on many types of CPUs including Intel, AMD and some mobile phone processors. 

# What does it mean?

This allows malware running on the device to potentially access protected data like passwords or other secrets in a similar fashion to the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities discovered earlier this year.

# What is being done?

Microsoft and other Operating System developers are working on updates that will mitigate the issue and these updates should be applied as soon as they are released.

# What can I expect?

These updates will likely affect the performance of machines by approximately 2 to 10%. Intel and AMD are working on hardware fixes to this family of issues in their next release of CPUs, but expect similar vulnerabilities to continue to be disclosed now that the general class of attacks has been made available to security researchers.

# What should I do now?
At this time, you can be proactive by making sure your computer's operating system is up to date and your IT professionals are aware.
